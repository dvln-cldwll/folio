      <h2>Sk1n</h2>
      <p>
       Generative drawing using a small selection of skin tones from Pantone, specific tones gathered from Humanae, an ongoing piece by Angelika Dass;
SK1N is created by applying the aforementioned values to primitive shapes.
Pantone colors, in print media are considered to be the standard.
By standardizing a color mixing process, colors will appear as 
intended throughought different print media, printed from different sources.
I am interested in taking that standardization of color, applying it to skin tone
(inspiration from 'Humanae', by Angelika Dass). however instead of cataloguing individuals
as a set of standardized pantone colors, I want to apply those colors to a screen, 
creating a computer generated drawing using the data, giving a "skin color" to a computer screen.
the primitives chosen, a mix of arcs, lines, ellipses, triangles, rectangles, and quadrangles, 
are placed and overlaped in order to attempt to represent the texture of human skin. 
6 different color vaules are chosen, 2 sets of "light, mid, and dark" tones, which were referenced
from Dass's Piece. The RGB vaules for these tones were used.
I want to explore the idea of applying coroporation mandanated (Pantone) skin tones to a machine generated drawing, 
ideally giving a human like color to something as inorganic as a computer screen, as well as the interest in 
how varied the drawings could be. I am thinking in terms of the evolution of computer technology, AI, and the evolutions thereof.
Skin tone is not deemed trivial by our society, it isn't an objective label that can be used to organize people, and the heirarchy is man made. 
I want to juxtapose something that has an unfortunately impactful meaning (Skin color, and the "value" of certain skin tones even though man made,
and not a concrete ruling, are still unfortunately prevalent in the majority North American Society, and Institutions) with something as 
logical, and objective as a computer, and a coding language, to see what happens by combining a trait from humans, who mostly operate emotionally, 
versus computers, who operate logically, and operate on a very linear structure
